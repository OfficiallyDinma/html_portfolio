<p>My name is DIEIH SANDRA CHIDINMA, and I am from Delta State, Nigeria.
I am a staff member of Auchi Polytechnic, Auchi, where I carry out my professional
duties with dedication and pride. 
I come from a family of four siblings,all girls, which has shaped my strong sense of sisterhood,
 independence, and resilience. At 32 years old, I embrace life with confidence,
purpose, and a deep appreciation for growth.</p>

  Physically, I stand at 5ft 5 inches tall, with caramel skin, 
  a bursty and slim-thick figure that reflects both confidence and self-acceptance. 
  Beyond appearance, my personality truly defines me. I am funny, expressive and naturally curious.
   As a sapiosexual, I am deeply attracted to intelligence and meaningful conversations, and as an idealist,
    I believe in possibilities, personal values, and the power of becoming better every day.

  I love food and genuinely enjoy eating and trying new dishes, especially exploring new flavors and cuisines. 
  I also love traveling and learning new things, as new experiences inspire and broaden my perspective. 
  In addition to my career, I run a small business and proudly own two brands: WetnessPlug and Dira-Luxury, which represent my entrepreneurial spirit, 
  creativity, and drive to build something of my own. Overall, I am a woman who blends ambition, humor, intelligence, and passion into everything I do.
